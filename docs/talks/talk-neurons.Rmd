### Interoperability,

### accessibility,

### & reproducibility,

### *before* 

### finalising analyses 

</div>

<div class = "notes">
- traditional blackbox statistics
- shame
- final steps should be at the start
- facilitates collaboration
- science should be collaborative
- reproducibility and analysis should be a romance, not a war
</div>



## [Living analysis](https://covid-nma.com/) is the smallest perk for the analyst | It's all a bit much, though

<div class = "notes">
- living analysis is very spiffy, show Cochrane
- but is least best thing
- better is scope for collaboration
- much better for analysis design: what figures need to be created? Make a mock up, understanding the structure of data outputs is golden
- BUT challenges are manifold
- Respect collaborative science as much as, say, statistics
- Allow for time to do it (contracts are ~1 year for both my analyses)

# `spunk::` | What is this?

## **spunk**

*noun*

1.INFORMAL

courage and determination.

"she's got no spunk, or she'd have left him long ago"

(Oxford English Dictionary)

<div class = "notes">
You may or may not be familiar with this definition of spunk

</div>


## Nope, not that *spunk*

### According to Urban Dictionary...

## **spunk**

Refers to semenal fluid, and also means to ejaculate.

1. *If you spunk on the wall, wipe it up!*
2. *The spunk was stuck to his ear.*

(Urban Dictionary)

## If the `spunk::` fits

`spunk::` is the [reproducible packaged living analysis](https://github.com/softloud/spunk) accompanying the Cochrane review:


</br>


### **Nutritional interventions for male infertility:** 
#### *a systematic review and meta-analysis* 

</br>


</br>

which examines nutritional interventions for [sperm](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=spunk) motility, sperm morphology, sperm volume, and sperm count.

<div class = "notes">
- describe Cochrane https://www.cochrane.org/
- define systematic review and meta-analysis
- now that we've defined the project, we will not discuss infertility for the rest of talk
- what did I learn from this, what opinions have I formed, will be the rest of this talk
</div>

# Who the living analysis is for

## Analysts care about the science of data | Domain experts care more about the stories [data](https://softloud.github.io/spunk/dataset.html) tell

```{r out.width="70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("show-off.gif")
```


<div class = "notes">
- fancy models pressure from superiors and peers
- but my stats are crap; I need help
- fancy stats may not be the most significant contribution of a scientific project
- domain experts are often not primarily statisticians
- domain experts often have *some* ability, how to cater for them, without ego
- they can't learn all of R
- good argument to make 
- show ?spunk_dat
</div>

## Collaborative data science

### Implementing other models

</br>

Here is the pipeline for fitting the network meta-analysis models. Functions are documented using `roxygen::2` and can be searched using R, for example, 

`?smd_calc`...

From [Contributing](https://softloud.github.io/spunk/extending.html)

<div class = "notes">
- analyses are rudimentory
- patchable
- more effort put into collaboration than into fancy stats
- hard, time consuming, but 
- transparent, accessible, reproducible (for yourself!)
</div>

## Living analysis

When the data is updated, the [analyses](https://softloud.github.io/spunk/sof.html) can be updated.
