library(sperm)

```


## Installation

The `sperm::` analysis is available at [GitHub](https://github.com/softloud/sperm) with:


Either download the codebase (green `Code` button) as a .zip file or use GitHub command-line interface (`gh cli`)

``` bash
gh repo clone softloud/sperm
```

The raw data are preloaded in the packaged analysis which can be accessed by installing the `sperm::` package:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("softloud/sperm")
```

`sperm::` is created using `targets::` so that each step in the analysis can be accessed.

```r
install.packages("targets")
```

`sperm::`'s analysis pipeline can be viewed:

```{r message=FALSE}
tar_glimpse()
```

`sperm::` uses the `renv::` package to snapshot the versions of packages used to ensure reproducibility, run this command to load the required packages after opening the R project.

```r
renv::restore()
```



# Raw data

The raw data was last downloaded: 

```{r}
here::here("data", "count_obs.rda") %>%
  file.info() %>%
  pull(ctime)

```

There are four raw datasets preloaded in `sperm::` package: `count_obs`, `morphology_obs`, `motility_obs`, and `volumne_obs` scraped from the googlesheet. 

```{r}
